You can go to Login → Get Started → DATA ADMINISTRATION, select file type (input, context or output) then click submit.
Users can create an output tree or output tree can be generated automatically based on the input and context tree. Once the “test case group” is created, users can edit input,context and output trees.
Once the “test case group” is created, users can edit input,context and output trees. Basically, you can generate the test case group first and then edit the information.
The output tree can be auto generated or the user can manually create the tree. User can manipulate this output tree to model the expected output.
Yes, you can.
Thank you this sugguest!
The output tree can be auto generated or the user can manually create the tree.
Application output is stored in the form of String. This output is generated by the application.
Expected output is generated from output tree and stored as tree (similar to the input and context tree).
You can simply provide input for the test cases and then perform the execute test case action.
Expected output is generated from the output tree once “generate test cases” action triggered. If this action is interrupted then test case generation will be terminated.
Then the test case generation will be terminated.
Expected output is generated from the output tree. Application output is generated after the execution of test cases. Expected output tree will be used to compare actual application output to rate the quality。

In the child node user can put all the possible output strings or output tree can be generated automatically based on the input and context tree.
Go to  Login → Get Started → Test Case Group
1. Click view test case action 2. Select input test case and click view test case action  to see context test case 3. Click on the “Expected Output” or “Application Output” column  to view the output respectively
Auto file versioning is not available but if you. Name the files accordingly and then user can store multiple versions of the file. Also, copy tree function is available
No. Currently we do not have this facility.
Yes. You can generate different expected output tree for same input and context group.
